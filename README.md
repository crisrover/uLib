# uLib
Micro C libray developed for my own personal use.
The library contains various functions and wrappers that were developed for my needs, and for now it is lacking a lot of features that I wanted to put in, but due to time limitations I didn't get around to implement.
Will be expanded in the future on a need basis.

## Description 
This library is developed as header only.
The code compiles as both C and C++.
In the future Linux versions of the current Windows implementations will be added.

## Features
For now, the main features are:

* LIFO vector implementation
* Function for recurse traverse a given Windows path retrieving files and folders
* Various file manipulation wrappers
* Some string manipulation functions
* Various WinApi wrappers
